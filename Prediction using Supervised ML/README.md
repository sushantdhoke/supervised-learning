# Prediction using Supervised ML
Supervised learning is when the model is getting trained on a labelled dataset. A labelled dataset is one that has both input and output parameters. In this type of learning both training and validation, datasets are labelled.

## Problem Statement
Predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.
What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?

## Solution

Simple Linear Regression is performed with the train-test-split technique for Machine Learning implementation. Also, a scatter plot with the regression line is plotted. 
At the end the error of the model is calculated.
